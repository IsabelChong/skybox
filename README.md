# SkyBox 🌌📦
##### An "infinite" obstacle game created using Unity with C# 👾.
##### Created as a tutorial into Unity 3D game development~

Note: I tried various settings to enable gameplay on WebGL and here are the settings that worked for me! (At a cost of its lagginess)

<p>Build Settings: Player Settings > Publish Settings > Compression Format > Gzip (Decompression Fallback Checked or Unchecked)
(As of Unity2021.3.2f1)</p>
