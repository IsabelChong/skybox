# SkyBox 🌌📦
##### An "infinite" obstacle game created using Unity with C# 👾.
##### Created as a tutorial into Unity 3D game development~

p.s I tried various settings to enable gameplay on WebGL and here are the settings that worked for me! (At a cost of its lagginess)
Build Settings: Player Settings > Publish Settings > Compression Format > Gzip (Decompression Fallback Checked or Unchecked)
(As of Unity2021.3.2f1)

<p><a href = "https://play.unity.com/mg/other/skybox_webgzip">play it here!</a></p>

<i>Features include:</i>
- Custom Gradient Night Sky Skybox Material.
- Distance Scoring System with Highscore.
- Player Audio Effects and Theme Audio.
- Randomly Generated Sections of Obstacles.
